## Simple To-do with React.

# What I have done?

- useState hook to manage the state of the component.

- event.preventDefault() in addTodo function to prevent the default form submission behavior.

- Different functions ('deleteTodo', 'saveEditTodo', 'cancelEditTodo', and 'toggleComplete') to update the state of todos array.

- map function to iterate through the todos array and render the list items dynamically.

- key prop for each list item, to render and update the list efficiently.

- sorting functionality for the todos list.

- edit functionality using editTodoIndex and editTodoValue state variables.

- Tried to use conventional names and follow the best practices of React to be clean and easy to understand.
